# Fire Emblem Heroes: Arena Team Buider

I've wanted to build a webapp that functions much like the Team Builder in the game, but allow for an easier way to see stats and skills at a glance.

**This project is built using Angular2.

## Running the app

- 'cd' into the duelcrest directory and type 'npm start'
